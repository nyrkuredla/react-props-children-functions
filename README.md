# screaming-dinosaur
This was an Iron Yard assignment for September 25, 2017. It was intended to help us practice rendering child components and managing props and state, but I used the time to additionally create a dinosaur that screams whatever you type into the text box.

I find it easier to learn things if they amuse me, and screaming dinosaurs are pretty much inherently funny. 

Technologies used: React, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
